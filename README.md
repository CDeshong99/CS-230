# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room wanted a web-based version of their team-based drawing and guessing game, Draw It or Lose It. The software needed to support multiple teams, enforce unique names, ensure a single instance of the game in memory, and be scalable.
# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The detailed identification of design constraints and system architecture was well-executed, ensuring clarity in the software’s functional and technical requirements.
# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Structuring the document to outline design constraints, system architecture, and implementation strategies helped ensure alignment between requirements and development.
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The evaluation section could be refined with more in-depth comparisons of operating platforms. Improving this would enhance clarity on why specific choices were made
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The design incorporated user requirements like scalability, cross-platform compatibility, and unique identifiers. Understanding user needs ensures the software is functional, efficient, and user-friendly.
# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
The use of microservices, the Singleton pattern, and cloud-based architecture optimized performance and scalability. In future projects, leveraging containerization (e.g., Docker) and CI/CD pipelines would further enhance efficiency.
